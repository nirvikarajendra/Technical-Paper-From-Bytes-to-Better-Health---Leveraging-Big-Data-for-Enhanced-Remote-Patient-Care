## Technical Paper: From Bytes to Better Health - Leveraging Big Data for Enhanced Remote Patient Care

- This paper examines how big data, IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing remote patient care by enabling continuous health monitoring, predictive analytics, and personalized medicine. The integration of wearable devices, cloud computing, and machine learning allows healthcare systems to analyze vast, real-time datasets to improve diagnosis, optimize resource use, and support data-driven clinical decision-making.

- The study reviews key advancements such as deep ensemble learning, Hadoop MapReduce, and Apache Spark for large-scale data processing, alongside federated learning and blockchain for ensuring privacy and data security. By combining these technologies, healthcare providers can enhance predictive accuracy, reduce hospital readmissions, and deliver proactive care for remote patients.

Ultimately, the paper highlights that responsible and scalable use of big data can transform healthcare delivery—bridging technology and medicine to create a more responsive, efficient, and secure system for remote patient monitoring and improved global health outcomes.
